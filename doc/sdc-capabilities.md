Not supported


### Scoring
Ability to add up the ordinalValue of all choice questions into a total score.

![total_score](images/total_score.png)

Total score will be entered into any field which meets one of the following:
- has extension `sdc-questionnaire-calculatedExpression` (**regardless of content of the expression!**)
- has extension `cqf-expression` (**regardless of content of the expression!**)
- is readOnly and has unit `{score}`

**No true support for FHIRPath or CQL expressions is provided!** Any field which has one of the trigger extensions will
have a total score calculcated, regardless of content of the expression!

### Response creation

#### Reference to Questionnaire
A canonical reference to the questionnaire will be generated, including a version number.

The `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/display` extension will not be set.

#### Status
Status can be set to any of the supported values. Setting the status to complete does currently not have impact on items affected by enableWhen (they should be discarded).

#### Authored
Will be set to the current time.

#### Narrative
A narrative will be auto-generated. Its status will be `generated`, unless it is `empty`.

#### Answers
All detail from the questions in the questionnaire carries over into the Response.

Choice answers will be marked as "user selected".
